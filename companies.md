# Verified Companies List
## Verification Criteria
The companies in this list fall into one of three categories:
1. The company actively uses prison labor to manufacture its own products
2. The company supplies its products/materials to manufacture other, non-branded goods
3. The company is part of an organization (such as ALEC) that has been instrumental in the expansion of prison labor and the privatization of prisons

We try to make sure that all of the companies on this list have a recent (< 1 year), reputable source to back up our claim. If a parent company is included on our list (such as Pfizer), its popular subsidiaries are included. However, if information can only be found on a single subsidiary, its parent company and other related subsidiaries are not included.

**Company:** Haystack Mountain  
[**Source**](https://haystackmountaincheese.com/our-story/)  
**Description:** Haystack Mountain partners with CCI and its Skyline Correctional Center. The prisoners here run a dairy farm that supplies Haystack Mountain with the milk it needs to produce its cheese. We understand that in some cases, work such as this can be a good experience for the prisoners and help them find work and reacclimate into society once released. However, as the NPR article states, these prisoners are still only making "a few dollars a day". **In this case we are not necessarily advocating for the program to be shut down, but for the workers to be paid better wages.** [Source](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/07/20/538062911/whats-it-really-like-to-work-in-a-prison-goat-milk-farm-we-asked-inmates)
