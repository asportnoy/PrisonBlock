# BadBusiness
A Cloud-To-Butt look-alike for companies that use prison labor

## v1.0
The premise is simple--any companies that use prison labor have their name changed to "INSERT STATEMENT HERE" any time it appears on a webpage".

## v2.0
Could also add chrome url overrides to block certain webpages (v2.0)

If you have any other companies that you know use prison labor and want added to the list, feel free to contact me at teddy.lambert@gatech.edu or, if you know git, create a pull request and add the company to the `companies.txt` file so we can review the addition!

Thanks!

# Acknowledgements
The idea and initial company list are all thanks to Ella Lambert. I only dealt with helping turn the idea into an implementable reality.

The implementation follows laurenorsini [Caaaaarbs](https://github.com/laurenorsini/caaaaarbs) and Steven Frank's [Cloud to Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt). Thanks for the inspiration!
