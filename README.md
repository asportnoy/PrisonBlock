# BadBusiness
A Cloud-To-Butt look-alike for companies that use prison labor.

If you have any other companies that you know use prison labor and want added to the list, feel free to contact me at teddy.lambert@gatech.edu or, if you know git, create a pull request and add the company to the `companies.txt` file so we can review the addition!

Thanks!

## v1.0
Any companies that use prison labor have their name changed to "DON'T BUY" any time it appears on a webpage".

## v2.0
A pop-up will appear any time you try to access the website of a company that uses prison labor. The popup will make you confirm you want to be on the site to continue.

# Acknowledgements
The idea and initial company list are all thanks to Ella Lambert. I only dealt with helping turn the idea into an implementable reality.

The implementation follows laurenorsini [Caaaaarbs](https://github.com/laurenorsini/caaaaarbs) and Steven Frank's [Cloud to Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt). Thanks for the inspiration!
